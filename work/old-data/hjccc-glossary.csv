Aizu-Hongo,"A ceramic center that encompasses Aizu-Hongo and Aizu-Wakamatsu in the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan. Kilns in this area began producing porcelain around 1800 and these wares were exported to Tokyo and throughout the northeast part of Honshu. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Aizu-Hongo wares were also exported to the United States (Crueger et al. 2006:228).  Aizu-Hongo teapots decorated with sometsuke peony motifs appear in American import catalogs from 1907 and 1916 (Van Patten 1997:11,16). Shark-skin glazed teapots, also likely from Aizu-Hongo, appear in 1914 and 1916 catalogs (Litts 1988:44; Van Patten 1994:37).

Around 1870, gosu was replaced by a chemically-produced and less expensive cobalt oxide (kobaluto) that creates a brighter, more intense blue (Jahn 2004:342).
