## About the Collection

The Historical Japanese Ceramic Comparative Collection (HJCCC) contains digital photographs and resources for identifying and describing Japanese ceramics manufactured during the Meiji and Taisho eras (roughly the nineteenth to early twentieth centuries). The intent of this collection is to provide archaeologists and other researchers with comparative examples of historical Japanese ceramics that are found on North American archaeological sites.

### Background

Many of the ceramics in this collection originally belonged to a diverse group of Japanese laborers, families, and American citizens who arrived in North America between approximately 1880 and 1924 and who are collectively known as Issei (Densho Encyclopedia 2017). As material remnants of daily life; these ceramics not only provide insight into the nineteenth and twentieth-century Japanese ceramics industry and international exchanges of art, technology, and commercial goods; they also contribute to studies examining the experiences of Issei and their descendants.  

### The Collection

Although the HJCCC is not an exhaustive type collection of historical Japanese ceramics, the vessels it contains are examples of an important artifact class about which relatively little has been published. The intent of this collection is to assist in identification of historical Japanese ceramics, to help standardize terminology, and to encourage further research.

In order to represent a more diverse cross-section of ceramics, the items in this collection are from multiple sources. Information about the parent collections and to the curation facilities that house them can be found at the links to the right.

Many of the terms used to describe the ceramics in this collection are based on a classification system that relies on Japanese language terms. By incorporating Japanese terms for vessel forms and design concepts, HJCCC terminology attempts to match the way that the Japanese ceramics industry describes their products, and the way that Issei communities would have understood the vessels that are the focus of this collection. This classification system was developed in collaboration with Japanese ceramics expert Leland Bibb and continues to grow with the input and collaboration of other researchers. An abbreviated typology for forms can be seen [here], and full definitions of Japanese terms can be found in the HJCCC [Glossary].
