            <h2>About the {{ site.title }}</h2>

            <p>The Historical Japanese Ceramic Comparative Collection (HJCCC) contains digital photographs and resources for identifying and describing Japanese ceramics manufactured during the Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa eras (roughly the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). This collection provides researchers with comparative examples of Japanese ceramics that are found on North American archaeological sites. The HJCCC is intended to assist in identification of historical Japanese ceramics, to encourage the use of standardized terminology, and to promote further research.</p>
                      
            <p>The collection was created by University of Idaho Historical Archaeology Ph.D. Candidate Renae Capmbell as part of her 2018 <a href="https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu">CDIL</a> Digital Scholarship Fellowship. She received assistance with coding, processing, and design from Evan Williamson, Jessica Wilson-Saia, Kevin Dobbins, and Devin Becker.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>Many of the ceramics in this collection originally belonged to a diverse group of Japanese laborers, families, and American citizens who arrived in North America between approximately 1880 and 1924 and who are collectively known as Issei (Densho Encyclopedia 2017). These items are material remnants of the nineteenth and twentieth-century Japanese ceramics industry, lingering evidence of international trade and migration, and components of daily life that contribute to a more complete understanding of the Issei experiences in North America.</p>
            
            <p>Much of the material on this website is drawn from my master’s research in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Idaho. This research examined collections of Japanese ceramics from archaeological sites in Washington, Oregon, and California that were occupied by Issei between 1903 and 1942. My thesis (Campbell 2017a) proposed the working typology for Japanese ceramics that I use on this site and contributes to a growing body of research on the Japanese diaspora. Sources for learning more about the historical background of the Japanese ceramics industry, Japanese migration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Japanese diaspora sites in North America can be found in the References Cited below.</p>
            
            <h3>Collections</h3>

            <p>The HJCCC features examples of historical Japanese ceramics that are likely to be found on archaeological sites in North America. Although not exhaustive, this digital collection is designed to be a collaborative archive that will grow over time. In order to represent a more diverse selection of ceramics, HJCCC items are compiled from multiple sources.</p>
            
            <p>Roughly half of the items in the HJCCC are from Japanese Gulch Village, an archaeological site near Mukilteo, Washington, that was home to Japanese sawmill employees and their families between 1903 and 1928. Excavations at the site in the early 2000s recovered a collection of materials, including Japanese ceramics, that are now housed at the <a href="http://www.burkemuseum.org/" target="_blank">Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture</a> in Seattle (White et al. 2009). The Japanese Gulch Village collection is held in trust on behalf of the U.S. Air Force.</p>
            
            <p>The remainder of the ceramics featured in this digital collection are from the <a href="http://webpages.uidaho.edu/aacc/" target="_blank">Asian American Comparative Collection</a> (AACC) at the University of Idaho. The AACC maintains a comprehensive collection of Asian-manufactured objects that have been, or are likely to be, found in archaeological or museum contexts in the western United States. Unless otherwise noted, AACC objects are comparative examples of historical Japanese ceramics that did not come from archaeological sites.</p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>

            <p>The ceramics in this collection are classified according to Japanese nomenclature. By incorporating Japanese terms, HJCCC terminology attempts to match the way that the Japanese ceramics industry describes their products and the way that Issei communities would have understood the vessels that are featured in this collection. The HJCCC classification system was developed in collaboration with Japanese ceramics expert Leland Bibb (Campbell 2017a, 2017b) and continues to grow with the input and assistance of other researchers. An abbreviated typology for ceramic forms can be seen on the <a href="{{ '/forms.html' | relative_url }}">Forms page</a>, and full definitions of Japanese terms can be found in the HJCCC <a href="{{ '/glossary/' | relative_url }}">Glossary</a>.</p>
